    In 2020, our small staffing agency business changed its approach to supplying area buisnesses with workers for health care buisnesses in the greater Atlanta GA metro area due to the outbreak of Covid 19. We were faced with the biddest challenge of staying in buisiness when the whole country was shutting down in a climate where all healthcare workers were deemed essential. Where we could, many positions became fully remote, allowing staff to work from home and care for their families as schools had also been shutdown.In this new era their was a new demand for the work to still be done but in a new remote environment, that pleased many employers and employees alike. Thus began our new vision and company Snap remote work resource. Our business continues to grow over 4 years later, and our presence in over 30 states. Join us in our collective journey to excellence through filling the needs of the employer and the worker with a strong dedication to work life balance and productivity. See our map odf locations we service, find your right position today!
